# Cybersecurity Home Lab: Azure Server Setup and Penetration Testing

## Project Overview
This project involved creating and configuring a secure server environment using Microsoft Azure to simulate real-world security scenarios. The objective was to enhance my penetration testing skills by identifying and documenting vulnerabilities in a controlled cloud environment.

## Setup and Configuration
- **Platform:** Microsoft Azure
- **Environment:** Configured a virtual machine with hardened security settings suitable for penetration testing.
- **Purpose:** Hosted vulnerable applications to test and analyze real-world attack vectors and mitigation techniques.

## Testing and Analysis

### Network Scanning with Nmap
- **Tool Used:** [Nmap](https://nmap.org)
- **Purpose:** Conducted network scanning and discovery on the Azure server.
- **Process:**
  - Scanned for open ports, running services, and potential vulnerabilities.
  - Analyzed network footprint to identify possible entry points and attack vectors.
- **Outcome:** Documented findings on exposed ports and services, which served as a basis for further security assessments.

### Web Application Testing with Burp Suite
- **Tool Used:** [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp)
- **Purpose:** Performed security testing of web applications hosted on the server.
- **Process:**
  - Intercepted and manipulated HTTP/S requests to test for insecure authentication and input validation issues.
  - Used Burp Suite's scanning tools to detect potential web vulnerabilities.
- **Outcome:** Identified and documented weaknesses in application security, providing recommended mitigation strategies.

## Results
This project allowed me to:
- Gain hands-on experience with Azure and popular penetration testing tools.
- Understand the basics of cloud security and web application vulnerability testing.
- Document and assess security findings, which I used to improve security configurations.

**Note:** All testing was conducted in a controlled lab environment with no external impact.
