# Python Password Cracking Tool

This is a Python-based **Password Cracking Tool** designed for **educational purposes**. It demonstrates both **brute-force** and **dictionary-based** methods for cracking passwords. The tool will attempt to guess the target password either by trying all possible combinations (brute-force) or by using a pre-defined wordlist (dictionary attack).

## Features
- **Brute-force attack**: Generates all combinations of lowercase letters and digits, trying each combination until the correct password is found.
- **Dictionary-based attack**: Attempts to match the password using a list of common passwords from a user-provided wordlist file.
- **Time Tracking**: The tool tracks and displays how long it takes to crack the password, allowing for performance comparisons between methods.

## How It Works
1. **Brute-force attack**: The script generates all combinations of lowercase letters and digits and checks them against the target password.
2. **Dictionary-based attack**: The script reads a wordlist (a text file containing potential passwords) and tries each word until it finds the correct password.

## Installation
To use this project, you need Python installed on your local machine.

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-cracking-tool.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd password-cracking-tool
    ```

3. Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python password_cracker.py
    ```

## Usage
When you run the script, you will be asked to choose the cracking method:

1. **Brute Force**: The tool will generate all combinations of lowercase letters and digits to find the correct password.
2. **Dictionary**: The tool will attempt to match the password using a wordlist file. You will be prompted to enter the path to your wordlist file.

### Example:
```bash
Welcome to the Python Password Cracking Tool!
Choose cracking method (1 for Brute Force, 2 for Dictionary): 1
Enter the target password: password123

Using Brute Force Method...
Trying: p
Trying: a
Trying: s
Trying: s
Trying: w
Trying: o
Trying: r
Trying: d
Trying: 1
Trying: 2
Trying: 3
Password cracked! The password is: password123
Time taken: 0.0043 seconds
